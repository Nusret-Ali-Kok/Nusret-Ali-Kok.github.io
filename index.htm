        <h2>Imperial College Business School: AI Solutions Architect</h2>
        <p>Alh. At Imperial College Business School, I served as a Research Assistant on the AI-Enabled Data Intelligence System for Pharmaceutical Research from 2025 to the present. I architected a scalable, self-learning regex system and AI pipeline that processed over 650,000 pharmaceutical data points, improving accuracy by 87% and supporting BioPharma AI/DHT adoption research, with findings presented at a research conference. I engineered a multi-agent LLM pipeline with five specialized agents using advanced prompting techniques—including Chain-of-Thought reasoning, XML structuring, and shared reasoning—to convert static pattern recognition into dynamic data extraction.</p>
        <p>I also optimized system performance by over 50% through prompt engineering and inference cost reduction while maintaining processing quality at scale. My work involved close collaboration with senior non-technical stakeholders, including the Centre for Sectoral Economic Performance Co-Director, translating complex AI solutions into actionable business value. Additionally, I experimented with machine learning classification models on labeled data to automate pharmaceutical data analysis.</p>

        <h2>Imperial MSc Thesis: AI-Driven Global Innovation Ecosystem Evaluation Tool </h2>
        <p>Alh. For my Imperial MSc thesis on Applied AI for Multi-Department Research (2024–2025), I led the development of an AI-Driven Global Innovation Ecosystem Evaluation Tool as Team Leader and AI Solutions Architect. I built a Python-based LLM-driven autonomous assessment tool capable of producing 40 pages of research, a 1–2 page executive summary, five datasets, five graphical and five geospatial visualizations, 200 citations, and 54 Q&A in approximately one hour for £20, reducing what would have been 3–4 months of expert, multi-person research to a single automated run requiring no specialist expertise.
        <p>In this role, I led a team of six, coordinating cross-functional collaboration between research and development teams, and managed six stakeholders—from business and aerospace professors to a consultancy CEO—tailoring communications to each. I developed a custom evaluation framework using RAGAS, Convergence Criteria, Prompt Perturbation, and House of Quality to validate results, evaluate runs, and identify the most optimal LLM models. Recognized for leadership and stakeholder trust, I successfully convinced the department to approve an AI-related thesis by acting as a technical advisor and demonstrating LLM capabilities. I was also selected by the Sustainable Aviation Institute Head and Dr. Sergey V. Kravchenko, former Boeing International Vice President, to lead the Institute’s only year-long team project.</p>

In 2024, I was invited back to an AI convention for which I had previously hosted a booth on “LLMs and Their Potential.” This year, my booth focused on “What Is a Solutions Architect?”, where I framed AI as a general-purpose resource comparable to oil, electricity, and the internet, and defined Solutions Architects as engineers who translate such foundational technologies into practical solutions for real-world challenges. As part of my presentation, I also  presented both my MSc thesis and Imperial College Business School research.</p>

        <h2>Aeronautics MSc Studies</h2>
        <p>Alh. During my Aerospace Master’s studies at Imperial College, the journey was both challenging and deeply inspiring, shaped by the opportunity to learn from world-class professors and alongside exceptional peers. My experience began with two defining lectures: an aerospace-focused Introduction to Machine Learning, and Aeroelasticity. Early in the Aeroelasticity module, Professor Rafael Palacios demonstrated a wing undergoing aeroelastic behavior using a small wind tunnel brought into the classroom, an experience that strongly motivated me to engage with the subject. Despite being widely regarded as one of the most demanding modules in the programme alongside the Turbulence module, I chose to pursue Aeroelasticity, and it ultimately became one of the most intellectually stretching and rewarding parts of my studies.</p>
        <p>Across two academic terms, I undertook a broad and rigorous set of modules spanning Machine Learning, Vertical Flight Aircraft, Aircraft Structures, Aeroelasticity, Control Systems, Systems Engineering, Sustainable Aviation, Advanced Propulsion and Advanced Aerodynamics. Preparation for the mandatory Advanced Aerodynamics module involved extensive derivations and formula-based analysis, which I was able to study for in the unique learning environment of Imperial’s G-rooms, where entire walls functioned as whiteboards. The picture on the left was taken after several days of studying. Overall, the programme pushed the limits of my technical ability while offering a rare and immersive academic experience.</p>
        <p>I was also very fortunate to have Professor Kravchenko, former Boeing International Vice President, as one of my MSc thesis supervisors, alongside Professor Rafael Palacios. The picture on the left was taken when he introduced me to the aerospace startup Electra’s Senior Vice President of Product Development, James Stewart. He also introduced my team and me to Mr. Hemant Mistry, Director of Net Zero Transition at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with whom we had the opportunity to discuss our sustainable aviation research findings.</p>

        <h2>Imperial College London - Aero MSc</h2>
        <p>Alh. During my undergraduate studies at Cankaya University in Turkey, I was strongly motivated to pursue a master’s degree. I focused on my studies and graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.86, including a 4.0/4.0 GPA over my final two years. Supported by my graduation project and academic results, my family and I began preparing applications for a MSc, despite initially being uncertain about which universities or countries to target. We ultimately applied to ten universities across Europe and the United States, including Imperial College London and the University of California, Berkeley, tailoring each application individually with institution-specific motivation letters and requirements.</p>
        <p>Aerospace engineering emerged as my chosen field of study due to its association with innovation and the application of cutting-edge technology to complex, modern challenges, as well as my longstanding interest in aircraft. Although uncertain about my chances given the prestige of the programme, I was accepted into Imperial College London’s (#2'nd in the world by QS ranking) Aerospace Master’s programme within a cohort of approximately 50 students. This marked the beginning of an academically and personally formative journey, defined by close friendships and a strong sense of community. Over time, I came to recognize that much of the innovation I sought was more prevalent in Artificial Intelligence than in the commercial aircraft sector, where long certification cycles slow technological adoption, a realization that would later steer my interests after my MSc.</p>

        <h2>Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Graduation</h2>
        <p>Alh. I completed my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at Çankaya University in Turkey, a four-year program culminating in a year-long personal project. The Turkish education system emphasizes extensive academic preparation before university, leaving little opportunity to explore practical applications in the last two years of high school, so I entered university with limited hands-on experience but a strong interest in mechanical systems. My time at Çankaya was defined by learning how to study effectively; it was only after the first year and a half that I began going to a dedicated library, supported by friends and family who encouraged focused study sessions over social distractions. This environment, combined with a commitment to disciplined studying, enabled me to graduate with a cumulative GPA of 3.86\4 and a final two-year GPA of 4\4. I was very fortunate to graduate as the valedictorian of my cohort and with first-class honors. The picture on the left was taken on my graduation day, with the Head of Mechanical Engineering, Prof. Dr. Hasmet Turkoglu, and the Engineering Deen, Prof. Dr. Sitki Kemal Ider. I was very fortunate to receive recommendation letters from both of them. </p>

        <h2>Computational Fluid Dynamics For Nozzle Geometries</h2>
        <p>Alh. In addition to the mechanical work for my graduate project, I also developed a custom Python tool to optimize nozzle properties for fluid flow, and conducted and optimized multiphase CFD analyses to examine laminar flow nozzle behavior in atmospheric conditions.</p>
        <p>This nozzle was designed to be capable of dispersing pesticides accurately without affecting non-target plants in a farming field. Drawing on prior experience with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) from my coursework, I aimed to achieve laminar flow to maintain fluid cohesion during travel to the target. Initial CFD simulations revealed circulation points at the lower right corner of the nozzle (which can be seen in the second video) that disrupted laminar flow due to factors including inlet pressure and velocity, nozzle geometry, entrance angle, and the dimensions of the inner tubes. These issues were addressed by 3D printing the nozzle with a grid-structured infill, creating much narrower, precise pathways that allowed the fluid to maintain laminar flow and improve dispersion accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Design of 30 Parts and 4 Subsystems for a Farming UGV</h2>
        <p>Alh. From 2023 to 2024, I served as Systems Lead for the Turret, Fluid Dispersion, and Cooling subsystems on my bachelor’s graduation project, which focused on designing 30 parts and four subsystems for an unmanned farming ground vehicle. I designed, tested, and manufactured 30 unique 3D-printed components, including a custom laminar flow nozzle for stable fluid dispersion, a newly identified three-degree-of-freedom spherical gear-meshed ball joint for turret motion, Persian-inspired windcatcher towers for semi-passive cooling in non-stationary vehicles, and custom anemometers to support nozzle aiming under windy conditions. I also carried out the assembly, implementation, and coding of all electronic components. The three-degree-of-freedom spherical ball joint was rebuilt in CAD software after studying its structure through the inventors' publications. The produced 3d printed parts can be seen on the first picture, with a simulation of all parts being disassembled and reassembled on the middle video. The last video is a demonstration of how the ball joint works for multiple degrees-of-freedom. </p>

        <h2>Computational Fluid Dynamics for Pipe Geometries</h2>
        <p>Alh. One undergraduate coursework I particularly enjoyed involved demonstrating the effects of different pipe geometries on fluid flow, specifically their impact on velocity and pressure. As part of this project, our team designed various geometries, ran simulations in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and then 3D-printed the parts for real-world testing using pressure gauges to measure velocity and pressure. The CFD simulations for the different 3D-printed geometries can be seen in the accompanying video.</p>

        <h2>Patent</h2>
        <p>Alh. As part of a two-person team, I developed a Portable 3D-Printed Device for Low-Cost Torque-Adjustable Tension, Fatigue, and Tensile Testing. The device underwent multiple iterative design cycles, and the final product was recognized by instructors and selected for a University Patent Application. The patent has then been paused in the Under Review Phase.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the machine was to build accessible tension, fatigue, and tensile testing equipment for university students, as such machinery is typically expensive. By designing the device using 3D-printed components, students could download the files and print it themselves for use in coursework, whether for assembly, design exploration, or material testing. The first prototype, as seen on the accompanying visuals, included a metal plate on top to account for bending stresses, which was later replaced by a second pillar identical to the first on the lower half of the device. Testing specimens were also 3D printed with varying infill amounts, and the device incorporated a 3D-printed gearbox to increase the torque of a cheap Nema stepper motor.</p>

        <p>Alh. Through hands-on manufacturing experience, I learned principles of tolerance, producibility, sheet metal design, and manufacturing practices, while working directly with production personnel and technicians throughout design and fabrication processes. This experience emphasized the importance of compromise, machinery limitations, and the effectiveness of simplicity, and I earned access to all machinery by demonstrating discipline and respect toward production personnel and engineers. I designed and manufactured two projects using Autodesk Inventor, TIG welding, press bending, and assembly tools: a five-meter-tall puppet skeleton involving load-bearing analysis, shaping, and assembly of long beams, and a traditionally interlocked, full-metal multi-part katana hilt featuring an intricate, low-tolerance design secured by a single pin.</p>
